# Fakèmon-Battle

INSPIRATION 
    Growing up, I spent alot on time playing Pokèmon on my DS (particularly HeartGold/SoulSilver)
    Yeah... so here's Fakèmon lol.

HOW TO PLAY: 

This is a PVP game:
    -Player One gets to be Pikachu
    -Player Two gets to be Charmander

Relatively easy, you just wanna beat your opponent. 
Attack damage are randomly generated with a the damage range of 1-10

If player 1 wins then player 2 loses and vice versa.
