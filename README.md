# Fakèmon-Battle
Fakèmon Battle was created for my milestone projects for people to see my skills and knowledge built during Part 1 of my Bootcamp studies

# Inspiration
Growing up, I spent a lot of time playing Pokèmon on my DS (particularly HeartGold/SoulSilver) so I wanted to create something similar to the game.

Nintendo is currently remastering some of their Pokèmon game which is pretty nostaglic for me --> which brought me over to this.... Fakèmon (to avoid any copyright lol)

# How to Play
Just to clarify, this is PVP game between **Pikachu** (PLAYER 1) and **Charmander** (PLAYER 2)
There are four abilities for each characters
* Basic attack
* 2 Speciality attacks
* 1 ultimate attack

**Pikachu attacks:**
* Basic attack (10)
* Thunderbolt (3)
* Volt tackle (2)
* Thunderstorm (1)

**Charmander attacks:**
* Basic attack (10)
* Blaze (3)
* Ember (2)
* Fire blast (1)

Each skills/attacks damages are randomly generated

If Pikachu wins, Charmander loses.

If Charmander wins, Pikachu loses.
